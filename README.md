# Hit It 💥

**Hit It** transforms your combat feedback into a satisfying, Genshin-Impact-styled experience. It is a refined fork of *Immersive Damage Indicators*.

## Features

- ✨ **Genshin Style** - Beautiful, animated damage numbers that pop and float.
- 👁️ **Always Visible** - Damage indicators render *through* blocks and entities, so you never miss a hit (even behind walls!).
- 🌪️ **Smart Mechanics**:
    - **Random Offset**: Fast attacks spawn numbers in a random radius to prevent overlapping.
    - **Stacking Fate**: New numbers cause old ones to smoothly fade out, keeping your screen clean.
- 🔴 **Crit Feedback** - Critical hits have a distinct red color and a satisfying shake effect.
- 🎨 **Clean Visuals** - Normal hits are crisp white; no confusing rainbow colors, just clear feedback.

## Configuration

The configuration ensures you have control over the visuals:
- `Offset Radius`: Adjust how far apart numbers spawn.
- `Shake`: Toggle or tune the shake intensity for critical hits.

## Compatibility ⚠️

This fork is designed and tested **only for Minecraft 1.20.1**.
I do not guarantee that it will work on other versions or mod loaders.
